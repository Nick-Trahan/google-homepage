# google-homepage

From The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://theodinproject.com/courses/web-develop-101/lessons/html-css)

This is was a small project to help me get a better grasp on styling with CSS. The scope was only to copy the look of the Google home page (in my case, its the homepage from 10/29/2018), not the functionality. I may revist this project later to make the page "responsive".
